<h2>Projects</h2>
<p><strong>CET Ranking</strong><br/>
This project was done as a part of �Data structures in C� course in a group of 2, in which linked lists were used. We have written the code in such a way that it uses less time in sorting the marks of different students. It takes data of any number of students and gives out the rank based on the marks scored. Further we have used files in order to store the data.</p>
<p><strong>Line Follower Robot (LFR)</strong><br/>
This project was done as a part of �Microcontroller� course in a group of 2, in which we used embedded C code. This LFR works on arduino microcontrollers. The LFR follows black line sensed by the IR sensors. This robot can be used in various places like hospitals, hotels etc.
